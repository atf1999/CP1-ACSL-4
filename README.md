# CP1-ACSL-4
ACSL 4 for CP1.  Written in C++.

The task is a series of numbers are inputted into the program and then referenced against a set of data values.  If the value can be subtracted from the number without a negative value resulting, a one is added on to a value, if the number isn't, then a 0 is added. A binary value is then returned with the qualifying numbers you get
  Sample reference values: 8, 4, 2, 1
  Sample input: 8
  Binary: 1000
Since 8 can be subtracted from the eight without a negative returning, the first binary literal is 1, but since you cant subtract 4, 2, or 1 from 0 without getting a negative, the other three binary values are 0's.  The program also takes in multiple values seperated by commas, whose binaries are then crossed referenced to see if any of them match. Those that match are then passed
